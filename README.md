# scripts-misc
Random scripts I've made for random functions.

### Testpi.bat

I was having troubles where my Pi for occassionaly go offline for no reason and with my Pi running Pihole and some automated services I built for it, so this will check that the Pi is online.  I have task scheduled this to run on computer boot so it will be checked first thing when I boot my main desktop in the morning.

### ValheimBackup.ps1

A quick script to backup your Valheim character saves and worlds.  Very useful for a one click backup if you are using any mods and want to be save with your world and characters.

### RecycleBinClear.bat

A very quick bat file that I bind to my keyboard for quickly emptying the reycle bin because I like to keep it nice and tidy.

### universesandbox.bat

There are some achievements for the original Universe Sandbox game that require you to open the game x amount of times where the highest achievement is 10000 times.  This script will continously open and close the game making the achievement significantly easier to get.  The start path will need to be updated to where you have Universe Sandbox installed.

### autowalker.ahk

Great for games that require you to walk a certain amount of steps or a certain distance, this will walk you back and forth endlessly.  Press space to start the loop and then space again to end it.

### house_flipper_2_painter.ahk

There is an achievement in House Flipper 2 that requires you to paint a certain amount of sistance.  This will click and hold the paint roller to the wall and then move it back and forth endlessly.  Press space to start the loop and then space again to end it.
