# scripts-misc
Random scripts I've made for random functions.

### Testpi.bat

I was having troubles where my Pi for occassionaly go offline for no reason and with my Pi running Pihole and some automated services I built for it, so this will check that the Pi is online.  I have task scheduled this to run on computer boot so it will be checked first thing when I boot my main desktop in the morning.

### ValheimBackup.ps1

A quick script to backup your Valheim character saves and worlds.  Very useful for a one click backup if you are using any mods and want to be save with your world and characters.
